# Aspasia - Le Monde au delà de l'Expérience
_Online Art Exhibition_


During my time working as a trainee at L'Hôtel des Arts de Toulon, I was in charge of finding innovative and attractive ideas in terms of UI/UX in order to bring more users, more specifically young ones, into the world of Art and museums. I love Art (paintings, sculptures, architectures, classical music etc.) and so know exactly what got me into it when I was young. If I put my French heritage aside, it was true artists working on video game series like Final Fantasy, Metal Gear, Dragon Quest, Romancing Saga and more as a kid that truly brought me to this world of colors, dreams, realities with their incredible technique and sense of imagination. Today, video games are a big part of our modern popular culture, and we can't deny the fact that this industry has incredible artists. I think of Yoshitaka Amano, Yoji Shinkawa and so many more who still inspire me today. With Aspasia, I wish to create an enjoyable, interesting and well-documented online experience for users.
